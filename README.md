# Augmented-Reality-Classifieds-Android-App with Wordpress Backend
I have long been working on this awesome Augmented Reality Classifieds Android App using Wordpress as a Backend. I have since been busy with other projects and haven't had time to continue to better the project. 
I have decided to invite other Augmented Reality Enthusiasts and Wordpress fanatics with love for all things Augmented Reality to further Advance the App with great ideas, features and possibilities for a great Open Source Augmented Reality Android App with Wordpress. 

# Features of the App
1. Facebook and Google login
2. Upload News Post with Images.
3. Upload Listing with Images.
4. Share comments on Listings and News post. 
5. View listings in GPS Overlay Augmented Reality. 
7. Location Proximity Filter in Augmented Reality View
8. Category Filter in Augmented Reality View
9. Categories for News posts and Listings
10. User profiles, Categories, Listings and News Post can be updated from the Wordpress Backend.

# Augmented Reality SDK used: Mixare
mixare (mix Augmented Reality Engine) is a free open source augmented reality browser, which is published under the GPLv3.

# Bugs 
The app is not finished and may be buggy but fairly stable with limited crashes.
